# Suite Desktop

## Main differences between suite-web and suite-desktop builds

### trezor-connect API

-   suite-web

    `trezor-connect` is hosted at `[url]/build/static/connect` and injected as an iframe into DOM.

    `iframe.postMessage/iframe.onmessage` interface is used as communication channel between suite and connect API.

-   suite-desktop

    `trezor-connect` is installed as regular node_module in electron main process and works in nodejs environment.

    `trezor-connect` files are **not** hosted on the electron renderer side, there is no iframe or /build/static/connect dir.

    `Electron.IpcRenderer.send/Electron.IpcRenderer.on` interface is used as communication channel between suite (electron renderer) and connect API (electron main). see @trezor/suite-desktop/src-electron/trezor-connect-preload.ts

### Firmware binaries

-   suite-web

    newest firmware binaries are hosted at `[url]/build/static/connect/data/firmware` and they are downloaded using regular `fetch` API.

-   suite-desktop

    firmware binaries are bundled as application resources in `bin` directory, full path depends on OS but it could be found on the as level as `app.asar` file, and they are downloaded using `fs.readFile` API. see @trezor/rollout/src/utils/fetch

## Debugging (VS Code)

Using VS Code configuration files (inside `.vscode`), Suite Desktop can be built and run with a debugger attached to it. Running the `Suite-Desktop: App` task (F5) will execute all required scripts (Webpack development server + Electron build) and launch the Electron app. VS Code will be set in debugging mode, allowing you, for example, to set breakpoints and inspect variables inside the `electron-src` folder (as well as other dependencies). For more on Debugging, please refer to [the VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

Known issue: The devtools might blank out at launch. If this happens, simply close and re-open the devtools (CTRL + SHIFT + I).

## Logging

Logging can be enabled by running Suite with the command line flag `--log-level=LEVEL` (replace _LEVEL_ with _error_, _warn_, _info_ or _debug_ based on the logging you wish to display). Additional command line flags can be found [below](#runtime-flags).

More technical information can be found on the [Desktop Logger page](../misc/desktop_logger.md).

## Shortcuts

_TODO_

## Runtime flags

Runtime flags can be used when running the Suite Desktop executable, enabling or disabling certain features. For example: `./Trezor-Suite-20.10.1.AppImage --disable-csp` will run with this flag turned on, which will result in the Content Security Policy being disabled.

Available flags:

| name                  | description                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Mock

Some libraries are difficult to test in development environments, such as the auto-updater. In order to still allow certain interactions with the feature in developments, libraries can be mocked.

### How to use mocks?

-   By default, development builds load mocks.
-   Non-development builds can include mocks if the `USE_MOCKS` environment variable is defined.

### How to make a new mock?

1. Open the suite-desktop build script located at `/packages/suite-desktop/scripts/build.js`.
2. Add a new entry to the `mocks` object. The key should be the name of the package, exactly as written when imported. The value should be the path to the mock file to point to (located in `/packages/suite-desktop/src-electron/mocks`).
3. Create the file in `/packages/suite-desktop/src-electron/mocks` and export mocked properties that you have imported across the project.

### Mocked libraries

#### Auto-Updater

The auto-updater has been mocked to simulate similar behavior to the actual library. Unless the command line parameter `--mock-trigger-updater-after=DELAY` is passed, checking for updates will always return `not-available`. This command line parameter requires a value, representing a delay in seconds before making the update available. Using `0` as a value will make the update available immediately. For example, if you wish to make an update available after 1 minute, you will use the parameter as follows: `--mock-trigger-updater-after=60`. Note that his parameter is **ONLY** available with mocks enabled.

## Debugging build

#### Linux

`./Trezor-Suite-20.10.1.AppImage --log-level=debug`

#### MacOS

`./Trezor\ Suite.app/Contents/MacOS/Trezor\ Suite --log-level=debug`

#### NixOS

`appimage-run ./Trezor-Suite.AppImage --log-level=debug`

## Extract application

#### MacOS

`npx asar extract ./Trezor\ Suite.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar ./decompiled`

#### NixOS

Run application to get mount-id like:

```
