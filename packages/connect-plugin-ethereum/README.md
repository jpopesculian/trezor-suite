# @trezor/connect-plugin-ethereum

<!-- [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@trezor/connect-plugin-ethereum.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/@trezor/connect-plugin-ethereum) -->

The Trezor Model 1 firmware currently does not support constructing EIP-712
hashes. However, it supports signing pre-constructed hashes.

EIP-712 hashes can be constructed with the plugin function
["@trezor/connect-plugin-ethereum typedData"](./typedData.js)

You may also wish to construct your own hashes using a different library.
